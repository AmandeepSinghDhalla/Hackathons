### Welcome to the Hack-A-Thon Repository.
Hackathons are a great way to practice your skills and concepts in of any field and also check that where you stand with your peers. Participating in hackathons enable us to explore unique problem statements and learn more about different types of work and projects that are going on in our respective fields of study or occupation.

In this repository, I will be sharing my approach, solution file and final rank in all the hackathons that I have participated into and what are the challenges that I faced during solving the problem statement.
